"""Probes — read what the machine says about itself.

INSTRUCTOR SOLUTION. Do not distribute. The student copy of this file has the
body of every function below replaced by `raise NotImplementedError`.

Every probe takes a `root` argument and reads nothing outside it. That is not
decoration: it is what makes this lab gradeable without twenty boards on a
desk, and it is the reason the test suite can present a fake SD-booted machine
and check that the student's code notices. Code that hardcodes "/" cannot be
tested, and a measurement you cannot test is a measurement you cannot trust —
which is the whole argument of Lecture 01, applied to the student's own code.

Each probe returns a dict with, at minimum, a `value` and a `source` key. The
`source` is the path or command the value came from. A number without its
provenance is not evidence, so the report format refuses to carry one.
